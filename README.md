# Spiking
- mostly graded, but some are all or nothing (e.g. AWA) (Jiang et al., 2022).
# Neurotransmitters
- ACh: excitatory
- glut: excitatory (e.g. sensory neuron ASH) and inhibitory (e.g. sensory neuron AWC, M3) (C. elegans II, 2nd edition).
# Similar pairs
- DVA/AQR
  - DVA: dorso-rectal ganglion, stretch receptor in up ventral cord to nerve ring
  - AQR: sensory neuron is head, oxygen and CO2 sensory
- AWCL/AWCR
  - both in the head (lateral ganglia), senses odor, light, electricity, heat.
# Different pairs
- ADLR/ADLL
  - lateral ganglia, sense chemicals, odor, pheromones
